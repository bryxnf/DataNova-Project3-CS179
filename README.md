This program is a Cargo Ship Re-Stowage Planner that reads a manifest, uses an optimization search algorithm to find the minimum-cost (time) sequence of container moves to achieve legal weight balance, displays high-contrast, step-by-step instructions to the crane operator, and generates a time-stamped log file and a new OUTBOUND manifest.
